## Introduction

**london_weather** dataset is a collaction of data ranging from 1979-01-01 until 2020-12-31, which contains information about climate in London. Using scripts in sql/data_exploration folder it is possible to examine the corpus. 

### Weather Data Example

This dataset contains daily weather measurements including cloud cover, sunshine duration, global radiation, and various temperature metrics.

| Date       | Cloud Cover | Sunshine | Global Radiation | Max Temp | Mean Temp | Min Temp | Precipitation | Pressure | Snow Depth |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|

### Data Cleanup

Data cleanup can be performed using scripts in sql/data_cleanup folder. It **includes altering data types, handling missing values and identifying outliers**. 

- 01_alter_type.sql - changes the date type to timestamp without time zone.
- 02_missing_values.sql - updates the missing values in the original 'readings' table with the monthly averages.
- 03_monthly_averages.sql & 04_monthly_standard_deviations.sql - calculate monthly averages and standard deviations for each variable, values used in other scripts.
- 04_identifying_outliers.sql - Flags mean_temp values as outliers if their z-scores are greater than 3

## Data Analysis

In this step, using scripts from sql/data_analysis I conducted a simple data analysis. The scripts return min and max temperature observed in London during the whole time period covered by the dataset. Additionally, script 03_get_monthly_avg returns monthly average temperatures, which is later used in visualizations.
